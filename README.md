# 📧 Spam Mail Detection using Machine Learning

This project is a machine learning-based spam email classifier that identifies whether an email is **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)** using natural language processing techniques. It leverages TF-IDF vectorization to process text and trains a Logistic Regression model for classification.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data handling
- **Scikit-learn** – ML modeling & evaluation
- **TF-IDF Vectorizer** – Feature extraction from text
- **Logistic Regression** – Classifier for spam detection

## 🚀 Features

- Cleaned and preprocessed dataset
- High-accuracy spam detection model
- User input support to test custom emails at runtime
- Lightweight and beginner-friendly codebase

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset consists of labeled emails with categories `"ham"` and `"spam"`, which are encoded and vectorized for training.

## 🔍 Model Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning & Label Encoding**
2. **Train-Test Split**
3. **TF-IDF Vectorization**
4. **Logistic Regression Model Training**
5. **Prediction & Accuracy Evaluation**
6. **Runtime Input Prediction**
